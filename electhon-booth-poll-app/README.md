# Electhon Booth Poll App

This repository contains two subfolders: booth-polls and booth-server. The booth-polls folder contains a React TypeScript application that serves as a registration form, while the booth-server folder contains the server-side logic that interacts with the database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/username/electhon-booth-poll-app.git`
2. Navigate to booth-polls folder: `cd booth-polls`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run the app: `npm start`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 in your browser

To run booth-server, navigate to the booth-server folder using `cd booth-server` and run the following command:

```nodemon index```


The server should now be running on http://localhost:3001.

## Usage

Once the booth-polls application is running, users can access the registration form by navigating to http://localhost:3000 in their browser. Upon submitting the form, the booth-server application will process the data and store it in the database.
