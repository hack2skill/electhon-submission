# Electhon'23 : Problem Statement 2

SaralVote - We propose an end-to-end solution to this timely issue to spread in-time awareness, streamline the voting process, and also to provide targeted encouragement for enhanced participation.



# Problem Statement

Why voter turnout rate is low in India?
* Lack of awareness about the end-to-end election process
* The busy schedule of today's youth considers it to be a time-consuming process, primarily due to long queues!
* Some people believe that casting their vote will not make a big difference and see it to be only heavy on their pockets. 

We propose an end-to-end solution to this timely issue to spread in-time awareness, streamline the voting process, and also to provide targeted encouragement for enhanced participation.

How do we intend to do it?
* **Targeting youth**: Voters who have reached the voting age are encouraged in a fun and interactive way to enroll for voter ID cards by youth constituency ambassadors incentivized by the ECI.
* **Gen-Z awareness**: Social media is the new word-of-mouth! We involve mass influencers across India, to interact through online platforms promoting election anthems/jingles and spreading the word. 
* **Partial Digitization**: Proposal of an add-on feature in the Umang App, wherein QR code scanning provides seamless verification from the first two Polling officers, a slot-booking feature to avoid long queues, and bonus/coupons for first-time users.

# Key Value Proposition
- Igniting Electoral Passion
- Accessing the Social Media Generation
- Hassle-free Voting
- Fostering Youth Participation
- Accelerate Voting Procedure
- A helping hand for ECI



# Proposed Solution



# Technology Stack
