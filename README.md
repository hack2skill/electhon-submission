## A Brief of the Prototype:

### What is your solution? and how it works.

The entire product is a digital platform that aims to improve the voting experience for urban and youth voters in India. It is accessible through a web-based portal or a mobile application, and requires users to log in using their Aadhaar Card and Voter ID.

The platform features several key components, including the mainframe for login, Digi Voter to reduce wait times and improve the verification process, Neta GPT to provide accurate and timely information about candidates and their platforms, and AR Navigation to help voters locate polling booths easily.

Overall, the platform aims to address common challenges faced by urban and youth voters, such as long wait times, limited access to information, and logistical issues related to transportation and scheduling. By leveraging technology and providing access to reliable information, the platform seeks to increase voter participation and ensure that more voices are heard in the democratic process.
