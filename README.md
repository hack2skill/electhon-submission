## A Brief of the Prototype:
Our solution is a generative AI model that uses natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning algorithms to create unique and engaging advertisements for each community. Our solution is built on the GPT-3.5 architecture, a large language model trained by OpenAI. The model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, and fine-tuned on specific election-related keywords and phrases.
The input to the model is a set of parameters such as location, demographics, and popular local references. The model generates an advertisement based on these parameters, which is then reviewed by a team of human experts to ensure quality and relevance.
We have also designed a plan for efficient distrubution of generated content using google analytics and google ads.

## Code Execution Instruction:
