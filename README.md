## A Brief of the Prototype:
  What is your solution? and how it works.
  Our goal is to develop an interface/website that rates a user's participation in election activities. This includes creating a leaderboard that ranks users and assigns badges, providing them with a sense of pride and satisfaction.
To increase confidence in the election process, we aim to develop a modern electronic voting machine (EVM) that is connected to a network of EVMs. This will provide real-time updates and vote counting, reducing vote tampering and ensuring instant results.

## Code Execution Instruction:
