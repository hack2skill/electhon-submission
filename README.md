#### Team Leader Email - anandsagar152@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
  What is your solution?
  
  Solution - The idea is to use a metaverse game scenario and a gui to encourage and educate
urban and youth voters in India to participate in the democratic process and increase
voter turnout. The game scenario will be designed to simulate the various challenges,
along with 3D metaverse representing the same scenario, and will feature electronic
boards with messages that encourage people to vote.

● A Gui will be developed where we educate voters by conducting :
Interactive quizzes and the overall process of elections and its importance.
● The metaverse game scenario will consist of multiple levels, each representing a
different aspect of the voting process, such as waiting in line, finding the correct
polling station, filling out the ballot correctly, and navigating through a crowd of
protestors and various challenges and obstacles that the player must overcome to
successfully cast their vote, such as impatient voters in the queue and aggressive
protestors.
