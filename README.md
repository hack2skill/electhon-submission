#### Team Leader Email - jagatankit177@gmail.com

## A Brief of the Prototype:
Basically, We built a website that offers the following features:

1. Simplified registration forms that make the registration process more accessible and user-friendly for potential voters.
2. Online registration options allow voters to register from the comfort of their own homes, reducing the barriers posed by physical registration centers.
3. When Online registration is done, a pop-up generates with a scratch card(we may be tied up with many companies).
4. In the above discussion we take money from that companies for promoting their platforms with a scratch card method. We use promo code on some product which is only on their platform. As a result, users will also get benefits for registering online and the government and the company make money from this solution.
5. Same-day voter registration policies allow eligible voters to register to vote on the day of the election itself, reducing the barriers posed by strict registration deadlines.
