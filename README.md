## A Brief of the Prototype:

  We humbly propose a solution to address the issue of lengthy queues during elections. Our proposed approach involves allowing voters to book their preferred time slots based on their convenience and availability, leading to a more efficient and organized voting process. We believe that this solution would benefit all parties involved by reducing queue lengths and distributing voters evenly across available time slots.

Our proposal is inspired by the concept of "Digiyatra" introduced by the Government of India. Digiyatra is a digital travel initiative that aims to provide a seamless travel experience for passengers. The initiative incorporates technology such as biometric authentication and facial recognition to streamline the check-in process and reduce waiting times. Our proposed solution follows a similar approach, utilizing technology to improve the voting experience for citizens.

Moreover, our proposed system would enable election officials to manage crowds more effectively by providing better assistance and ensuring a smooth voting process without any interruptions. With reduced queue lengths, officials could address any issues that may arise promptly, protecting the right of every citizen to vote.


## Code Execution Instruction:
  There are three part of our solution
  1-Frontend Part
  
    To run the frontend part first clone the repo and then run the command npm install and then npm start --force then the  website runs on PORT 3000 
    
  2-Backend
  
    To run the backend first do npm install the dotenv should not be included but we are including it for your convienience just run the command npm install 
    then the command npm start so the backend started running on PORT 4000
    
  3- ML Model for face detection
  
      To run this just cone the repo and run the command pip install -r requirements.txt
  
 The Repository must contain your **Execution Plan PDF*.
