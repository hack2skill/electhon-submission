## A Brief of the Prototype:
  State-based automatic voter registration refers to the process by which state
governments register citizens to vote using relevant eligibility information already
maintained by government agencies without any affirmative steps by potential
registrants. By reducing the step sand actions required on the voterâ€™s part to register,
automatic registration results in fewer voters facing registration barriers to voting, and
allows citizens to better participate in the democratic process.

## Code Execution Instruction:
  Download the Eclipse ide and add the project to the explorer
