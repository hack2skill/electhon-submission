## A Brief of the Prototype:
  
  My app provides a gamified solution for the youth, so they are encouraged to vote. After the influencer push, everyone want to be famous on social media, and what unique way to do it than having custom verfifed batch againt your name on your social media account. But will it be easy to earn the badge? Depends on the determination. But is the badge only benefit, No you can avail many extra benefits too, like priority queue access, shoutout on socials from ECI, or advertisement feature by ECI, or a meet with officials to discuss your view, or merch.
  
  Great isn't it, now to earn the token you simple have to post/reel/tweet about the election on your account and Voila done. To boost the token count you can also visit hidden QR signs accross the city and upload a selfie on the app to get a extra boost of tokens.
  
## Code Execution Instruction:
  Simple install the APK on the android phone.
