## A Brief of the Prototype:
What is your solution? and how it works.
The metaverse is a virtual world that allows people to interact with each other and their surroundings through avatars or digital representations of themselves. It has the potential to revolutionize youth engagement by creating new opportunities for interaction and collaboration.
We can develop a Metaverse that can be a digital twin of polling booth, etc where youth voters can understand the protocols in a fun and engaging way. There can be different levels that a user can visit and can also win a digital/ NFT that represents India in the challenge.
The metaverse will be a digital representation of diversity of India, showing different geographical regions. We can deploy these Metaverse on Google cloud, hence can be accessed via website links and QR.

## Code Execution Instruction:
Below is the deployment links for the VR experiences. These can be accessed either via any 3dof headset, or via any device.
