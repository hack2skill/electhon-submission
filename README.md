# Electhon - 2023

#### Team Name - HackOverFlow
#### Problem Statement - How can we increase the participation of urban and youth voters in elections to ensure their involvement in the democratic process?
#### Team Leader Email -  20eucs018@skcet.ac.in

## A Brief of the Prototype:
  What is your solution? and how it works.

Our application Democratic Desk is a integration of separate application services into
a single application , which serves as one-end solution for all services.
We have included two fascinating facts that will inspire voting in order to enhance the
turnout of urban and young voters.
Template creation
Referential programme
Developing a system for timeslot reservations voting and analysis of line lengths and
updating estimated wait times.

Additionally, To enhance the registration of the voter identification we have introduced
the concept of campaigning in colleges.
Some people, such as those who halted their study after high school or who
immediately enrolled in higher education overseas, will fail to register their voter
identification during college elections, thus it is important to prevent situations like this
from occurring.
We could implement the idea of pre-registering for the voter id campaign in schools
to prevent situations like this.

## Code Execution Instruction:
  *[If your solution is **not** application based, you can ignore this para]
  
 *The Repository must contain your **Execution Plan PDF**.

This app contains two parts, the frontend and the backend.

To start the frontend,
 - cd frontend
 - Configure the backend domain in the .env file
 - run 'npm install'
 - run 'npm run start' to start the frontend
 

To start the backend,
 - Install all necessary PHP extensions, composer as well as wkhtmltopdf and imagick extensions.
 - cd backend
 - composer install
 - Configure the credentials in .env file
 - run 'php artisan migrate --seed' to migrate the databse and seed fake data.
 - run 'php artisan serve' to start the backend
