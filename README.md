## A Brief of the Prototype:
  An engaging, user-friendly portal for the youth and urban folks to celebrate the festival of democracy and encourage their participation in Elections. The platform caters to develop a positive attitude towards exercising the ‘Right to Vote’ through timer based gamified experiences (Political Gamble quiz, Collect the ballot) integrated with incentives for topping the leader-board (referrals/content creation/winning vouchers/chance to meet a celebrity)! It incorporates details of the election calendar and a section for general awareness (Chunaav Paathshaala - about voter-id card, EVMs and booths) into the games while advocating the idea of volunteering to help others to spread awareness and help the specially abled, elderly, women and transgender to embrace the Election festival in collaboration with college communities(like NSS) and NGOs and awarding them with digital certificates and AICTE points for the curriculum. With modern-day conveniences like online slot-booking , navigating to nearest booth to save time and request any assistance (like wheelchairs, Braille EVMs), we invite the users to discuss their thoughts on voice-chat rooms and community forums to get a better political picture. Nowadays, selfies and reels are the new normal , thus, it seeks to encourage election related content creation (articles, informative videos-published after verification, post selfies with Election related photo-filters) and reward coupons to them for contributing, voting and referring peers to vote. To enable this, we use a mechanism for Alert Mail and notifications to update them about election calendar, their status of vote and contesting candidates.
